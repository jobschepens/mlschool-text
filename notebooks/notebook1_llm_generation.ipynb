    "üí° **Research Context:** Our goal is to create a high-quality `llm_frequency` predictor. The ECP dataset, which we use for validation in Notebook 2, contains a wide vocabulary from many sources (general use, dictionaries, etc.). To create a comparable predictor, we must generate a corpus that is equally diverse. A simple corpus (e.g., only children's stories) is insufficient. This session focuses on generating a varied corpus to capture a broad slice of the English language."

    "## 1.3 Large-Scale Corpus Generation (via Script)\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can generate small amounts of text interactively in this notebook, creating a multi-million word corpus requires a dedicated script that can run for a long time, save its progress, and handle potential interruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, we will use `scripts/script-1-gen.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Works:**\n",
    "1.  **Configuration File**: The script's behavior is controlled by a `.json` configuration file. We have created `scripts/config_2m_llama.json` specifically for generating our 2-million-word Llama 3.3 corpus.\n",
    "2.  **Seed vs. No Seed Words**: The script can use general, self-contained prompts across different genres to generate a diverse corpus without being biased by a specific word list or it can use seed words to \"inspire\" the LLM to write into a certain direction.\n",
    "3.  **State Management**: It continuously saves its progress to a state file (`.json`), so if the script is stopped, it can be resumed later without losing work or money.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To run the generation process, you would execute the following command in your terminal:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python scripts/script-1-gen.py --config scripts/config_2m_llama.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This process will run in the background to generate the `large_corpus_2m_llama.txt` file in the `output/` directory, which is essential for the next stages of our research. Note that you can change certain settings by making a new config file. For the purpose of this summer school session, a corpus has been pre-generated for you."
