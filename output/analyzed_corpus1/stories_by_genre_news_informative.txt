**Local Man Suffers Severe Backache After Late-Night Cola Binge**

*Springfield, May 5, 2024* — A 34-year-old Springfield resident is recovering from a surprising case of severe backache linked to excessive cola consumption, doctors say.

Jason Morales, a software developer, reported sharp, persistent pain in his lower back after drinking nearly two liters of cola over a 12-hour period while working late. “I thought it was just a stiff back from sitting too long,” Morales said. “But the pain got worse, and I couldn’t stand straight.”

Medical imaging revealed muscle strain and spinal misalignment—conditions doctors believe were exacerbated by dehydration and high caffeine intake from the cola. “While cola itself isn’t the direct cause, excessive consumption can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and increased muscle tension,” explained Dr. Lila Chen, a spinal specialist at Springfield General Hospital. “In extreme cases, like this one, it can contribute to unfixable spinal issues if ignored over time.”

Though Morales’s condition is now under control with physical therapy and reduced caffeine intake, doctors warn that chronic cola consumption may lead to long-term spinal problems. “We’re seeing more patients with back pain tied to lifestyle choices,” Dr. Chen noted. “This case is a reminder: even a simple drink can have serious consequences if consumed in excess.”

Health officials recommend limiting cola intake to one can per day and maintaining hydration and posture awareness to prevent such issues.

In the aftermath, town officials issued a statement promising a new round of public forums and a review of decision-making protocols. “We’re not going to let one defeat define us,” said Mayor Derek Mills. “We’re committed to ensuring that every resident—regardless of background or influence—has a voice.”

Meanwhile, the “Sovereignty Collective” announced plans to gather signatures for a petition demanding a referendum on local governance. While some residents believe the movement is a step toward greater equity, others worry it could deepen divisions.

For now, Eldenbrook remains a town in transition—one where the past may not easily yield to the future, but where the promise of change continues to reside in
