The village of Elderglen had forgotten the stars, until the **atheling** arrived.

He came not on horseback, but on a kite woven from moonlight and willow bark, drifting down from the craggy peaks like a whispered secret. His name was Caelen, son of no king, yet heir to a forgotten lineage whispered in old ballads. The **populace**, once resigned to dusty fields and silent hearths, gathered, eyes wide as saucers, as the boy landed with a soft *thump* in the village square.

"Who are you?" cried Old Maeris, the baker, her rolling pin frozen mid-air.

"I am Caelen," he said, voice like wind through reeds, "and I’ve come to **star**."

He didn’t mean fame. He meant the sky. He showed them how to tilt their faces, how to *listen* to the stars. He spoke of constellations shaped by forgotten heroes, of nebulae that sang lullabies in ancient tongues. He taught them to see the patterns – not just as distant lights, but as stories painted across the velvet dark.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Patch and Jacket
Begin by washing and ironing your jacket to remove any wrinkles. This ensures a smooth surface for your patch. Place the patch where you want it—on the sleeve, chest, or back—and secure it with pins or clips. Make sure it’s aligned just right; once sewn, it’s harder to adjust.

*Pro tip:* If your patch is thick (like a leather one), consider lightly ironing it to soften the edges and make it easier to handle.

### Step 1: Choose the Right Car (Fastback Advantage)

Opt for a **fastback** model—those sleek, aerodynamic vehicles with a smooth, sloping rear roofline. Why?

Bonus: The smooth design helps deflect stress (and the occasional flying granola bar).
